# Integration for a Dimplex LIK8TES heatpump via the
# NWPM Touch / pCOWeb Modbus TCP integration board.

#
# The pCOWeb board offers "analog" (actually int16 holding registers
# that need to be divided by 10...), "digital" (coils) and "integer"
# values (int16 holding registers starting at 5000). We'll call these
# |heatpump_float|, |heatpump_integer| and |heatpump_coil|.
# 
# This configuration minimizes traffic by using the |virtual_count| feature,
# creating a single "sensor" for each of the three types that requests _all_
# the values in one pymodbus request each. And we then use |template.yaml| to
# map these to single sensors (and divide by 10). HA and pymodbus perform a
# separate request per sensor, so adding hundreds of sensors here might
# overwhelm the pCOWeb board.
#
# The scan_interval between each request is set to ~2m with different prime
# values for each sensor type to avoid requests coinciding in time.
