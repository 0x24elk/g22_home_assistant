# Integration for a Dimplex LIK8TES heatpump via the
# NWPM Touch / pCOWeb Modbus TCP integration board.

#
# The pCOWeb board offers "analog" (actually int16 holding registers
# that need to be divided by 10...), "digital" (coils) and "integer"
# values (int16 holding registers).
# 
# This configuration minimizes traffic by using the |virtual_count| feature,
# creating a single "sensor" for each of the three types that requests _all_
# the values in one pymodbus requuest each. And we then use |template.yaml| to
# map these to single sensors (and divide by 10). HA and pymodbus perform a
# separate request per sensor, so adding hundreds of sensors here might
# overwhelm the pCOWeb board.

    # The configuration at dimplex.atlassian.net claims these are float16
    # but it seems in practice they are int16 (and simply need to be divided
    # by 10 after reading).

    # The values are made available as
    # |heatpump_analog, heatpump_analog_1, heatpump_analog_2, ...|
